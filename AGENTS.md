     * Develop specific business logic functions:  
       * add\_new\_batch\_to\_inventory  
       * dispatch\_stock (decrement source, increment destination current\_stock)  
       * record\_retail\_sale (decrement retail store current\_stock)  
       * record\_stock\_adjustment  
       * get\_expiring\_stock (query logic for expiry alerts).  
       * **New: Aggregate functions for dashboard data (e.g., get\_total\_products\_count, get\_total\_warehouse\_stock, get\_total\_retail\_stock, get\_expiring\_units\_count, get\_recent\_sales\_summary, get\_recent\_movements).**  
       * **New: Store-specific aggregate functions (e.g., get\_store\_current\_stock\_summary, get\_store\_sales\_today, get\_store\_upcoming\_deliveries).**  
  4. **API Development (FastAPI \- main.py):**  
     * Define API endpoints for each business operation (e.g., /products, /batches, /stock-movements, /expiring-stock).  
     * Implement request/response models using Pydantic for data validation.  
     * Connect endpoints to the service layer functions.  
     * **New: Dashboard API Endpoints:**
